## Slide 2

For some reason, my shinny app is only showing a gray screen on internet browser. I tried almost everything to fix but couldn't find a solution. I put a link of my github repo so you can download my server.R and ui.R to run my app on you computer and you can see that I did my project. Thank you for your understanding.
